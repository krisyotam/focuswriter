About
=====

This is my custom build of FocusWriter, where I plan to expand themes and potentially introduce additional minimalist features.

Portable Mode
=============

Create a folder named "Data" in the same folder as the executable
(the application bundle if using macOS) to run this program from a
USB drive. Simply rename or delete the "Data" folder if you later decide
you want it to start storing its settings and related files on the host
computer.

If you have already been using FocusWriter and would like to migrate its
themes to a USB drive, you will need to copy the "Themes" folder into the
newly created "Data" folder. The "Themes" folder is located in one of the
following places:

  Linux:
    ~/.local/share/GottCode/FocusWriter

  macOS:
    ~/Library/Application Support/GottCode/FocusWriter

  Windows:
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\GottCode\FocusWriter
